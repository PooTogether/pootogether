## PooTogether

### Intro: https://pootogether.medium.com/introducing-pootogether-a-no-loss-blockchain-lottery-5959dc820c9

PooTogether is a zero-loss blockchain lottery that works by generating interest (via yearn.finance) on all funds, then using the yield to buy a random shitcoin and send it to a winner periodically.

You can enjoy it on [pootogether.com](https://www.pootogether.com) and it currently only works with yUSD.

For more info, please read [the announcement](https://pootogether.medium.com/introducing-pootogether-a-no-loss-blockchain-lottery-5959dc820c9).

### Future plans

With the Ethereum congestion, our future plans are changing

Instead of doing another airdrop and starting to do regular draws, we are exploring alternative layer 2 options since reward draws are currently more expensive than the rewards themselves.
